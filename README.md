# EDE-Solver
Numerical Diff. Eq Solver using Singular Perturbation Analysis for Early Dark Enery Models w/ Neutrino-Assisted EDE. 

This system is designed to solve and analyze Equation (33) using singular perturbation methods. The key idea is to deal with the stiff, multi-scale behavior inherent in the equation—where a small parameter multiplies the highest derivative—by splitting the problem into fast (boundary layer) and slow (reduced) dynamics. By doing so, we can extract both the rapid oscillatory behavior (dominated by the small parameter) and the slowly decaying amplitude envelope.
