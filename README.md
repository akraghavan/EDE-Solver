# EDE-Solver
Numerical Diff. Eq Solver using Stiff and Nonstiff Methods for Complex Equations in Neutrino-Assisted Early Dark Enery Models. 

This system is designed to solve and analyze Equation (33) using singular perturbation methods. The key idea is to deal with the stiff, multi-scale behavior inherent in the equationâ€”where a small parameter multiplies the highest derivative. This is done primarily using the LSODA method of numerical integration, available through scipy (although it is a wrapper to the Fortran solver from ODEPACK). LSODA, written jointly with L. R. Petzold, solves systems dy/dt = f with a dense or banded Jacobian when the problem is stiff, but it automatically selects between non-stiff (Adams) and stiff (BDF) methods. It uses the non-stiff method initially, and dynamically monitors data in order to decide which method to use. By doing so, we can extract both the rapid oscillatory behavior (dominated by the small parameter) and the overarching amplitude envelope. 

In this particular implementation, the numerical methods are verified by comparison with analytically derived solutions of a simplified form, and both the analytical and numerical envelopes are superimposed and numerically compared.
